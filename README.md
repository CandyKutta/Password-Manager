# Password-Manager
This application will let you create ciphered passwords and store them in the lists.
Only on the user's desired key values, can the list be obtained and then know the list of the passwords.

Future Updates
Will improve my cyphers.
Will study secure data and about their safe storage on the database or the local repos.
Currently starting out with Django, the UI will improve drastically.
Plans on implementing Machine learning concepts for better understanding of suitable ciphers and storage based on the platform used and user preferences.
